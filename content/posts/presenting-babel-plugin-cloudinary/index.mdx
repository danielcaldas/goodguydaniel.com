<ScrollToTopButton />

During the past two months, I've been developing a side project at work, this started with me doing a simple refactor task. At the time I looked at the solution we had in place, and it was dirty, but it was necessary to skip some considerable performance penalty. Maybe it was something that we just had to learn to live with...

Hell no! At the time the alternatives weren't that promising, but soon I realized the potential of static code evaluation at build time with <a href="https://babeljs.io/" target="_blank" title="babel or babel.js is a free and open-source javascript compiler and configurable transpiler used in web development">babeljs</a>. I'm very proud to present <a href="https://github.com/trivago/babel-plugin-cloudinary" target="_blank" title="official repository for babel-plugin-cloudinary compile cloudinary urls at build time.">babel-plugin-cloudinary</a>. In <a href="https://tech.trivago.com/2019/04/02/presenting-babel-plugin-cloudinary/" target="_blank" title="trivago tech blog official tech blog for babel-plugin-cloudinary">this trivago tech blog article</a>, you can find all the details and motivation behind the plugin.
And by the way, if you want to know what the heck am I talking about, just take a look at the official repository of <a href="https://github.com/trivago/babel-plugin-cloudinary" target="_blank" title="official repository for babel-plugin-cloudinary compile cloudinary urls at build time.">babel-plugin-cloudinary</a>.
