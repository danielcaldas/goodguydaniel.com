I have this poor habit you know... Whenever I accumulate a lot of git stashes in some repository I just get a little maniac and start cleaning everything.

![please send help](./images/please-send-help.jpg "please send help doggo meme")

<Caption source="https://me.me/i/please-send-help-none-c0081e69a4f4419a824e82a234ac09e6" />

I found it sometimes even funny to open the terminal and play around with some bash to delete the stashes, look:

```bash
# if you're just flashing by don't copy and past this line into your terminal
for i in {1..10}; do git stash drop; done
```

Well, it happens that today (a few hours ago actually) I just did this and regretted the moment I did because there was this huge feature that for some reason I had locally stashed and not committed <br/> ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.

**Good news!**, the commits are not actually gone until git runs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)#Reachability_of_an_object" target="_blank" title="wiki page garbage collection">_garbage collection_</a>, so to check the list of commits that might still be rescued just go ahead and type:

```bash
git fsck --unreachable
```

or maybe

```bash
git fsck --unreachable | grep commit
```

because you actually need to check whether your hash is somewhere referenced as a **unreachable commit**.

Then all you need to do once you find your _stash_ (if you don't know the hash I'm afraid you will have to apply stashes until you find it) is just:

```bash
git stash apply <hash>
```

Here, some cool references on git stash:

Notice that the references above are from Atlassian, which I highly recommend when it comes to quick
search into a specific Git topic.

And that's it, hope this saves you just like it saved me.

Have a nice day.
