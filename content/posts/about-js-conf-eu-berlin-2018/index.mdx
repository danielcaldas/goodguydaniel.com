### For starters

As promised in the post on [CSSconf EU 2018](https://goodguydaniel.com/blog/about-css-conf-eu-berlin-2018/) I will now talk a bit about the JSConf EU 2018 that followed the CSSConf in the Berlin Arena (June 2nd and 3rd).

### Talks

As you're probably expecting the talks weren't exclusively technical (of course we got to see a few _hands on_ kind of presentation) topics ranged from ethics, productivity, history all the way to the more technical realm with performance, user experience, machine learning, IoT and of course the Javascript language itself <a href="https://2018.jsconf.eu/schedule/" target="_blank" title="jsconf eu 2018 berlin schedule">check out the conference full schedule</a>.

Now I'll focus on a few interesting talks that I had the change to see on each day, I'll give an overview on the content that was more meaningful (in my opinion of course). I'll break down the talks into <a href="#day-1" title="Day 1 talks">Day 1</a> and <a href="#day-2" title="Day 2 talks">Day 2</a>.

The opening talk was about errors [<span id="d1t1">(1)</span>](#day-1), yes errors. I've highlighted this topic because error handling is often forgotten or skipped but shouldn't this be part of the modelling process and architecture of our applications? Well that's another story.
Questioning type systems and discussing errors from a human perspective a pretty valid statement was pointed out
on Javascript error handling mechanism, **it is practically the same since it came out in <a href="https://codeburst.io/javascript-wtf-is-es6-es8-es-2017-ecmascript-dca859e4821c" target="_blank" title="JavaScript — WTF is ES6, ES8, ES 2017, ECMAScript… ?">ES3</a>**. Of course the language evolved in ways that try
to mitigate predictable runtime errors with static analysis, the ES5 brought along the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode" target="_blank" title="Strict mode">strict mode</a>, strict mode is basically (talk quote) _"disallow bad code that otherwise would be allowed according to the language grammar"_. Next a list of how typically errors are handled and here handled in the past was shown, from the classic _just crash_ classic to exceptions, signals, options/maybes....
Some conclusions here were:

- We need more robust way to deal with nullity (<a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining" target="_blank" title="tc39 optional chaining proposal">optional chaining tc39 proposal</a>)
- Expand ways to work with errors (e.g. _onError_ event listeners).
- Focusing on default arguments.
- Maintain good state in the face of user interaction while warning for events that caused transition to a bad one.

Next <a href="https://twitter.com/littledan?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank" title="daniel ehrenberg twitter">Daniel Ehrenberg</a> talks to us about numbers [<span id="d1t2">(2)</span>](#day-1). So the problem is that number representation in Javascript are limited to 2^35, as in:

```javascript
const x = 2 ** 53;
// x is 9007199254740992
const y = x + 1;
// y is again 9007199254740992
```

According to this presentation _long/ulong_ types where proposed back there (1999) in some of the first ECMA specifications, still they didn't make till the very end. But why this limitation in numerical representation in Javascript. Numbers in Javascript are 64-bit floating point binary numbers (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format" target="_blank" title="wikipedia double-precision floating-point format">IEEE 754 64-bit floats</a>), and they're structure is:

![binary floating point number representation](./images/binary-number-representation.png "binary floating point number representation")

<Caption
  source="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiU5OzMZ7z8"
  text="IEEE 754 64-bit floats"
/>

So the 2^53 maximum number (900719925474099**2**) looks like this when in the binary floating point representation:

> 0 10000110100 0...(x52)

Adding **1** we get:

> 0 10000110100 0...(x51)... **1**

that is 900719925474099**4**. So... Ok we get it, with a 64-bit representation it's impossible to represent all the numbers since you have the limitation of a 64-bit combination pattern to form numbers, at some point we need to round it, go up to infinity or throw an error.

But wait, is this a real use case? Yes, <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/twitter-ids.html" target="_blank" title="twitter developers twitter ids (snowflake)">checkout Twitter IDs (snowflake) issue</a> that made them add an `id_string` field so that when Javascript parses the id it keeps this unchanged id in the string format.
The proposed solution is <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-bigint" target="_blank" title="tc39/proposal-bigint">_BigInt_</a>. Not some library such as <a href="https://github.com/indutny/bn.js/" target="_blank" title="BigNum in pure javascript">bn.js</a>, instead a native Javascript supported BigInt type.

```javascript
x = 2n ** 53n;
// x is 9007199254740992n
y = x + 1n;
// y is now 9007199254740993n
// note that if you try and add a number you will get a TypeError
y = x + 1;
// Uncaught TypeError: Cannot mix BigInt and other types, use explicit conversions
```

You can check the progress of the proposal at the github repository <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-bigint" target="_blank" title="arbitrary precision integers in javascript">tc39/proposal-bigint</a>, it is at the time of this writing in stage 3.

In my opinion may solve huge corner cases as the one exposed previously, still I think it will make arithmetic operations less error prune since we can eventually now run into _TypeErrors_ for mixing numbers with BigInts. If BigInt is not explicit enough to developers we can start to fall into messy errors, but maybe I'm overreacting here.

[<span id="d1t3">(3)</span>](#day-1) You most certainly have seen the Philip Roberts' talk on the event loop <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ&t=4s" target="_blank" title="Philip Roberts: What the heck is the event loop anyway? | JSConf EU">_What the heck is the event loop anyway? | JSConf EU_</a>. If not, please stop reading this and watch that, it's way more important. In this next talk we dive into the event loop to learn that the event loop is a bit more complex than what you saw in Philip Roberts' talk.

To start we can think of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop" target="_blank" title="javascript mdn event loop">event loop</a> as the main function of the browser, something like:

```javascript
while (queue.waitForMessage()) {
  queue.processNextMessage();
}
```

A quick look into how task queues work on web browsers. So first _tasks_ are small unities of work to be executed from start to finish. Rendering pipeline in browsers is responsible for painting things in the browser. This pipeline can run when a task finishes, but the rendering pipeline has a separate time cycle and sometimes waiting is inevitable between the time a tasks finished and the time render pipeline runs again. Also if you have a task that takes really a long time to run the rendering pipeline has to wait, potentially your page will start to slow down at this point.

There are this things called micro-tasks (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises" target="_blank" title="guide using promises mdn">promises' callbacks are handled as micro-tasks</a>). Micro-tasks are handled differently than regular tasks, micro-tasks are queued in a micro task queue, this queue runs after each task and while the queue is emptying other micro-tasks might be added and executed in the same event loop tick.

![buzz and woody](./images/task-queue-meme.jpg "buzz and woody meme")

<Caption source="https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/13026863/TOYSTORY-EVERYWHERE" />

There's more. Animations have a dedicated queue as well the **animation frame callback queue**. When some animation tasks ends the event loop proceeds to the repaint, meaning that we don't wait up for new animation tasks that might appear, and it makes sense because if that happens it's because some animation was requested to be displayed in the next frame (thus in the next repaint).

At the end of these series of explanations we got the following pseudo code:

```javascript
while (true) {
  queue = getNextQueue();
  task = queue.pop();

  execute(task);

  while (microtaskQueue.hasTasks()) {
    doMicroTask();
  }

  if (isRepaintTime()) {
    animationTasks = animationQueue.copyTasks();

    for (task in animationTasks) {
      doAnimationTask(task);
    }

    repaint();
  }
}
```

And that should be it. **Now a quick peek into Node.js**. Node should be more simpler since:

- There are no scripting parsing events.
- There are no user interactions.
- There are no animation frame callbacks.
- There is no rendering pipeline.

A few interesting things:

- `setImmediate(callback)` is the same as `setTimeout(callback, 0)` but it runs first!
- `process.nextTick(callback)` all this callbacks will run before the promises callbacks.
- `setImmediate(callback)` does something on the next tick.
- `process.nextTick(callback)` does something immediately.

Below the pseudo-code for the Node event loop:

```javascript
while (tasksAreWaiting()) {
  queue = getNextQueue();

  while (queue.hasTasks()) {
    task = queue.pop();

    execute(task);

    while (nextTickQueue.hasTasks()) {
      doNextTickTask();
    }

    while (promiseQueue.hasTasks()) {
      doPromiseTask();
    }
  }
}
```

Regarding <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker" target="_blank" title="mdn web api worker">web workers</a> the only relevant fact pointed out is that they are simple to understand since each web worker runs it's own event loop on a separate thread and they are not allowed to manipulate DOM so no need to worry about user interactions here.

[<span id="d1t4">(4)</span>](#day-1) More than a year has passed since the release of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Concepts" target="_blank" title="">WebAssembly (WASM)</a>, it is still in its first steps towards what could be a game changer in web development (some say). In the next talk that I will mention WASM itself was introduced. So first of all WASM:

- It's not very web, it's only pure computation.
- It's not very assembly, it's not the code that actually runs on the machine, it's an abstraction.
- In WASM we cannot perform system calls (unless with explicit access).
- WASM cannot access additional hardware, you can check a simple example below.
- <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Understanding_the_text_format"
    target="_blank"
    title="mdn wasm understanding the text format"
  >
    Web assembly text-format (WAT)
  </a> is the assembly language for WASM.

```javascript:title=square.wasm
(module
  (func $square
    (export "square")
    (param $x i32)
    (result i32)
    (return
      (i32.mul (get_local $x) (get_local $x))
    )
  )
)
```

That's enough WAT for now, you're probably wondering how can we use WASM modules within javascript. It's actually simple, you just have a small amount of boilerplate to load the WASM module. Let's import and use `square.wasm` module.

```javascript
fetch("square.wasm")
  .then((response) => response.arrayBuffer())
  .then((bytes) => WebAssembly.instantiate(bytes, importObject))
  .then((results) => {
    const square = results.instance.exports.square;
    const x = square(2);

    console.log(x); // 4
  });
```

Of course you probably won't be using many native WAT modules, you will compile your C, C++, Rust or whatever into WASM, using it the same way we did above.

I think a very strong point was a little too much implicit during this talk, performance was mentioned still, with WASM we will be able to obtain a **more robust and coherent performance cross platform/browser** and **portability across operating systems and different CPU architectures**.

If you want to look more into the benefits or what actually could be achieved with WASM I highly recommend the two following talks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpuAqLCraAQ" target="_blank" title="real world webassembly chrome dev summit 2017">Real World WebAssembly (Chrome Dev Summit 2017)</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bac0dGQbUto" target="_blank" title="dan callahan: practical webassembly jsconf budapest 2017">Dan Callahan: Practical WebAssembly | JSConf Budapest 2017</a>.
