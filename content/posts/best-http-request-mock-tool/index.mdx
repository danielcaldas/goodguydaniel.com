#### tl;dr

Do you need to mock <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP" target="_blank" title="HTTP | MDN">HTTP requests</a> quickly? Use <a href="https://tweak-extension.com" target="_blank" title="tweak browser extension mock API simulator">tweak browser extension</a>.

<br />

#### Why?

When I first started my career in the software industry, I began to get familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application" target="_blank" title="Single-page application - Wikipedia">Single-page applications</a> and how
they interact with servers, mainly through HTTP requests to retrieve or send data to the
end-user. If you're working with the front end, there's a very high
chance you found yourself in one (or multiple) of the following scenarios.

#### The backend is not ready yet!

While the backend team is working on the endpoint X you need, you start working
on the UI change. You're using some static mocks hardcoded in the frontend or
something like <a href="https://storybook.js.org/" target="_blank" title="Storybook: UI component explorer for frontend developers">Storybook</a> to focus on the UI part of the task, and you'll
postpone the data integration.

#### The almighty irreproducible bug

All you get from the QA engineer is a JSON payload, without steps to reproduce the bug.
You take the backend response to figure out how it can affect the app. You want
to find a way to make that HTTP request to return your JSON payload.

#### Demo-day: the backend is down

On demo-day the backend service which your feature depends upon, it's down. What now?

#### What options we have?

Having experienced these scenarios multiple times, I thought about simple
alternatives such as proxying tools that would allow me to mock
HTTP responses. The solutions I found either didn't work or were overwhelmingly complex.

#### What if...

You had a **tool** that offers a consistent and pleasant experience, **enabling you to bypass the HTTP requests and**:

- **make them return whatever data you need**
- **right in the browser tab**
- **without writing any code**

#### That's why we built tweak!

The <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tweak/feahianecghpnipmhphmfgmpdodhcapi" target="_blank" title="tweak mock HTTP requests on chrome store">tweak is a browser extension</a> that
**allows you to change your HTTP requests to test, develop, and demo your web application**. Think
of it as your **customizable static API mock server in a chrome extension** that allows
you to change your HTTP requests on the fly!

<br />

<div style="display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;height: 340px;width: 100%;">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M7rMuNBw1xQ"
    style="min-height: 340px; width: 100%; margin: 4%; max-width: 720px; border: 0;"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

<br />

You can mock any HTTP request. You only need to provide **three simple things**:

1. **URL** that you wish to match,
2. **HTTP method** of the request you're targeting,
3. The **response payload** you would like to get instead of the actual server response.

There are plenty of other features bundled in the extension, and
the <a href="https://tweak-extension.com" target="_blank" title="tweak browser extension team">team</a> prepared
a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRCdRZzz6TTsNx67m9JFVxg" target="_blank" title="tweak youtube channel">few short videos</a> to guide you through some
of the most common use cases, give it a try!

I hope <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tweak/feahianecghpnipmhphmfgmpdodhcapi" target="_blank" title="tweak mock HTTP requests on chrome store">tweak</a> increases your productivity.

Do you identify yourself with the problems I mentioned
throughout the blog post? Are there any other scenarios
where you would use such a tool?
